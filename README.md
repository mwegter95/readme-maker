# Professional README Generator
## Built from starter code from U of MN Full Stack Flex Bootcamp

Hello, person who wants a nice README.md file for their github repo! This app works in your command line to ask you questions based on what makes the perfect README, and then automatically generates one for you with sections and formatting.

I, [mwegter95](github.com/mwegter95), coded this app using javascript and a package called inquirer.


This app was built using starter code from University of Minnesota Full Stack Flex Bootcamp. Check out the starter repo here <a src="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma" target="_blank">https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma</a>
